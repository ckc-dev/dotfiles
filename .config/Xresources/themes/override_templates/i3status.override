! Use this file to override colors for applications that do not look great using the default theme values.
! Copy this file to its appropriate theme folder, name it "<application>.override" (E.g.: gruvbox-dark/i3status.override) and include it in the overrides section in your .Xresources file.
! You should NOT use hardcoded color values, those should be obtained as variables from the main theme file. Ideally, only where each color variable is used should be overwritten.
! Uncomment only what you want to override and delete all others when done.

! Overrides for colors.
